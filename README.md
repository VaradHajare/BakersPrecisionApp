## About

- **Need for Precision:** Professional baking demands high accuracy in ingredient measurements to ensure consistent product quality and maintain standards.
- **Limitations of Volume:** Traditional volume-based measurements are inherently inaccurate due to variations in ingredient packing and density.
- **Online Recipe Inaccuracy:** Online platforms often perpetuate the problem by providing recipes with imprecise measurements.
- **Waste and Inefficiency:** Inaccurate measurements can lead to wasted ingredients, increased costs, and inefficiencies in professional baking environments.
